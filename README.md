Joomla 3's default theme comes with RWD, for those who don't want RWD, you can duplicate the default theme 'Protostar', remove the meta viewport in the index.php, then copy & paste this css file to replace the default one.
Depends on the width that you'd like to set for your theme, you'll have to change the 'width: 100%;' to the width in px.
This css file is based on Joomla 3.4.1
